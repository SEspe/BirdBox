# Functional Specification Document
## BirdBox — WiFi Nest Box / Feeder Camera with AI Species Identification
**Version:** 1.15
**Author:** SEspe
**Date:** 2026-07-07
**Changelog:**
- v1.15 — **Image rotation (mount-correction) implemented (firmware 0.14.0), extends §5.** New `rotation` setting (0&deg;/90&deg;/180&deg;/270&deg;, NVS-persisted) lets the physical mount orientation be corrected without re-gluing the camera module. The OV2640 only rotates 180&deg; in hardware (`camera_set_rotation()` toggles `hmirror`+`vflip` together — free, and since it happens at the sensor before JPEG encoding it corrects the live stream, SD-saved captures, and the species classifier all at once); there's no 90&deg;/270&deg; sensor register, and no JPEG-rotate routine exists in any dependency in this codebase, so real rotation at those two angles would mean a decode&rarr;rotate&rarr;re-encode step per frame — too expensive to run continuously at stream framerate. Scoped instead (user's explicit call) to **classifier-accurate, display-cosmetic** for 90&deg;/270&deg;: `classify.cpp`'s existing crop/resize loop (`decode_to_input`) gets its index mapping permuted for those two angles — same nearest-neighbor sampling, same source pixels, so there's no extra quality cost — while SD-saved JPEGs keep the sensor's native (unrotated) orientation at 90&deg;/270&deg;. The Live View `<img>` gets a pure CSS `rotate()` transform (via a `liveWrap` container sized with the classic centered-absolute + swapped-aspect-ratio trick) so what a person watching the stream sees is corrected too, even though the underlying bytes aren't. Settings tab gains the rotation dropdown (with the 90/270 caveat spelled out in-page); Live View tab gets its own lightweight rotation dropdown for a quick toggle without leaving the stream, both writing to the same `POST /api/settings` (`rot=`) and staying in sync. **Verified live on the reference unit** (over WiFi, no USB — OTA-flashed): a first visual check at 180&deg; showed no change, which turned out to be user/API state getting out of sync mid-test, not a firmware bug — a temporary REG04 register-readback debug field added to `/api/sysinfo` confirmed the hmirror+vflip bits do flip correctly (`0x28`&rarr;`0xF8`&rarr;`0x28`), and a clean re-test with a fresh capture showed the SD-saved JPEG genuinely rotated 180&deg; (roof edge and treeline flipped to the opposite corners); the debug field was removed once confirmed. 90&deg;/270&deg; classifier math was sanity-checked by POSTing a test photo to `/api/classify` at both angles — both returned clean, sane JSON (no crash, no out-of-bounds) — full accuracy verification needs a genuinely mis-mounted camera or a synthetic rotated test image, deferred until one is available. Also hit an unrelated **OTA flakiness at weak WiFi signal**: with RSSI around -88 dBm the ~1.1 MB upload reliably reset mid-transfer or hit the server's receive timeout (408); retrying once RSSI recovered to the -65&ndash;-70 dBm range succeeded immediately — no firmware fix, just a note that OTA over a marginal link may need a retry.
- v1.14 — **Species name language selection (firmware 0.13.0), extends §3.2.** Settings gains **Species name language: English / Norwegian**; the scientific (Latin) binomial is now always shown alongside the common name in whichever language is selected, so a result is never ambiguous even when a translation is missing. New `species_i18n.c`: a curated Latin→Norwegian lookup for ~80 species realistic at a Northern-European nest box or feeder (matching the v1 global model's documented regional deviation) — species outside the table still display correctly (English name + Latin), nothing is ever silently blank. `classify.cpp`'s decision logic now extracts the Latin binomial alongside the English common name (both come from the same Coral label, "Scientific name (Common Name)"); the visit-log CSV gains a trailing `latin` column (old rows without it parse fine — absent means "unknown", not an error). Localization happens **at display time**, not at write time: `/api/status` (ticker), `/api/stats/species`, and `/api/classify` all format the name server-side from the stored English name + Latin binomial + the current language setting, so changing the language setting immediately relabels historical data too, with no re-classification needed. A user-corrected species (Gallery relabeling, still deferred) intentionally drops the Latin name rather than misattributing the original guess's binomial to the correction. **A real bug caught during live verification:** `stats.c`'s original row parser used `strtok_r`, which collapses runs of adjacent delimiters — since the `corrected` column is always empty today (no relabeling UI yet), a row like `...,path,,Erithacus rubecula` made `strtok_r` skip straight past the empty `corrected` field and read the *latin* value into it instead, misattributing a real species' binomial as its own "corrected" label and overwriting the display name entirely (surfaced live as `/api/stats/species` returning a bare `"\n"` for pre-existing "unclassified" rows). Fixed by replacing the tokenizer with an explicit comma-scanning `next_field()` that never skips empty fields. Verified live on the reference device: `/api/classify` on the robin test photo returns `"European Robin (Erithacus rubecula)"` in English and `"Rødstrupe (Erithacus rubecula)"` in Norwegian from the same underlying event; `/api/stats/species` correctly relabels existing rows immediately on a language switch (`unclassified`/`ikke klassifisert`, `Unidentified bird`/`Uidentifisert fugl`) with no re-classification; the `lang` setting round-trips through NVS across a reboot. Firmware 0.13.0.
- v1.13 — **On-device species identification implemented (firmware 0.12.0), §3.2 core now live.** `classify.cpp` (TFLite-Micro via `espressif/esp-tflite-micro`, esp-nn kernels on the S3's vector unit): loads an int8-quantized 224×224 MobileNet-class classifier + index-aligned labels from `/sd/model` at boot (file chosen by the Settings region selector, else first `.tflite` found; ops verified against the reference model — only 6 kernels registered, keeping the op resolver minimal). Everything heavyweight sits in PSRAM: model ~3.9 MB, 3 MB tensor arena, decode buffers. **Asynchrony as specified:** the capture pipeline keeps a PSRAM copy of the event's best (first) frame and returns immediately; a dedicated classifier task (core 1, below motion priority) decodes it (esp_jpeg, auto-scaled → center-crop → nearest-resize to 224²), invokes the model, applies the settings confidence threshold and the "background" guard class ("no bird"), and only then writes the visit-log row — so CSV rows now carry real species + confidence, and the §3.4 stats species table/leaderboard becomes meaningful. Any failure (no model, queue full, decode error) falls back to the pre-§3.2 direct "unclassified" row: no event is ever unlogged. **v1 default model:** Google's iNaturalist-birds (965 species, Apache-2.0, global — a documented deviation from the planned Northern-Europe-only list, see §3.2 + `docs/MODEL.md`). The Coral download is uint8 and modern TFLM is int8-only ("Hybrid models are not supported"), so `tools/convert_model_int8.py` requantizes it offline — activations get a lossless zero-point shift, weights are requantized per-channel symmetric (worst-case error ½ LSB, no calibration data needed), biases recomputed exactly; the firmware feeds the int8 input by XOR 0x80 on the decoded pixels and scales output percentages from the tensor's quantization params. New endpoints (§6): `POST /model/upload?name=` installs model/labels files into `/sd/model` over the network (streamed under the §7 write lock, partial uploads deleted, no card-pulling needed) and `POST /api/classify` classifies a posted JPEG on demand (top-3 + decision JSON) — users can sanity-check their model without waiting for a bird. `/api/status` gains `species` (shown in the Live ticker), `/api/sysinfo` gains `clsModel`/`clsLabels`, and the Debug tab's Species ID card now shows model, label count and real last-inference timing. Settings' region dropdown now lists only `.tflite` files. Deferred to a later milestone: gallery label-correction + favorites (need per-event identity in the Gallery UI; the CSV `corrected` column and stats support for it already exist), and the on-flash model-partition fallback (SD required for now). Verified live on the reference device: clear Wikimedia test photos via `/api/classify` score European Robin 87% and Eurasian Blue Tit 86% (~4.3 s/inference); an obstructed great tit (top-2 Blue Tit 46%/Great Tit 28%) and a distant bird are both correctly guarded as "Unidentified bird"; a real motion event produced a classified visit-log row that surfaced in `/api/stats/species` and the status ticker; heap returns to ~1.1 MB free after inference (no leak, low-water 921 KB during decode). Firmware 0.12.0.
- v1.12 — **Retention pruning implemented (firmware 0.11.0), §3.1/§7 now fully live.** `storage.c` rechecks SD usage against `g_settings.sd_cap_pct` (already exposed in the Settings tab, default 80%) on every successful `storage_save_jpeg()` call — cheap when under cap (one `esp_vfs_fat_info()` call), so it costs nothing on the common path. Once over cap it deletes the oldest capture day-folder whole, one at a time (day-folder names sort lexicographically by date, so "oldest" is just the smallest name), rechecking usage after each deletion, bounded at 64 iterations so a corrupt state can't spin forever. **Today's own folder is never a pruning candidate**, even if it's the only folder left over cap — deleting the day currently being written to would race the capture still filling it; if nothing else is prunable the device logs a warning and stays over cap rather than eating today's captures. The `no-date` folder (pre-SNTP-sync captures) sorts after every real date, so it's the last resort rather than the first — its files' true age is unknown, unlike a dated folder's. **Species-favorite exemption is not yet implemented**: it arrives with §3.4's favorite-flagging (still deferred from the Gallery-tab milestone, v1.7) — there's no favorite flag on any event yet for pruning to check, so nothing is silently being ignored, there's just nothing to exempt. Verified live on the reference unit against real test data (not synthetic): with `2026-07-06` (18 files, prior milestones' test captures) and `no-date` (13 files, pre-sync test captures) sitting alongside today's `2026-07-07`, temporarily lowering the cap below actual usage triggered pruning that removed both old folders in oldest-first order across a single triggering write, correctly stopping once only today's folder remained. **That first test caught a real bug**: right after a reboot, before SNTP resyncs, the clock reads ~1970, so "today" computed as a bogus pre-2020 date that matched no real folder — the "never prune today" guard silently failed to recognize the actual current-day folder as today's, and a reboot-plus-motion-before-sync sequence wiped it. Fixed by having `prune_if_over_cap()` skip entirely (not just skip the today-check) whenever the clock reads pre-2020, mirroring `storage_save_jpeg()`'s own established pre-sync fallback — new captures already land in `/captures/no-date/` during that exact window anyway, so there's nothing dated to protect until the clock catches up. Re-verified after the fix: today's folder survives a low-cap trigger when it's the only folder present (clock synced), and a subsequent motion event correctly pruned a lingering `no-date` folder once the clock had synced, twice confirming the fixed guard. Firmware 0.11.0. **OTA Update tab implemented (firmware 0.10.0), §8 now live — all seven §5 tabs complete.** New `POST /ota/upload` (RemoteStart's proven pattern): raw `.bin` streamed straight to the inactive OTA slot via `esp_ota_write()`, boot partition switched only after a full, verified write (a partial upload just fails — it never leaves a half-written slot as the next boot target), bounded `httpd_req_recv()` timeout retries so one dropped packet doesn't abort a multi-hundred-KB upload (the v1.5 lesson). **The brick-proofing this milestone actually adds is bootloader rollback**, not just the upload plumbing: `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` turned on in `sdkconfig.defaults` (both targets — shared file), and `main.c` now calls `esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback()` once every subsystem has initialized without an `ESP_ERROR_CHECK` abort; an image that never reaches that call (crash-loops before finishing boot) gets automatically reverted to the previous slot on the next boot, with no user action needed. OTA tab: file picker + XHR upload with a progress bar, shown running version, and a plain-language explanation of the rollback safety net so users don't panic mid-flash. Verified live end-to-end over LAN: uploaded the running `BirdBox.bin` (1,065,856 bytes) back to the reference unit via `POST /ota/upload` — 200 OK in ~12 s, device rebooted into the alternate OTA slot, came back on the network reporting the same version with a fresh uptime, and a follow-up reset confirmed that slot reaches `boot complete` (and thus `esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback()`) cleanly — the rollback path was never triggered, as expected for a good image. Firmware 0.10.0.
- v1.10 — **Debug tab implemented (firmware 0.9.0), §5 now fully live; new `GET /api/sysinfo`.** Mirrors the RemoteStart Debug-card convention: a `housekeeping_task` in `main.c` samples `esp_get_free_heap_size()` every 10 s and tracks the lifetime low-water mark plus when it was hit (`g_heap_min`/`g_heap_min_ts_us`), so a slow leak shows up as an aging minimum long before the device actually runs low. Debug tab renders five cards from the one endpoint: **System** (free heap, low-water mark + age, uptime, WiFi reconnect count + last-reconnect age from the existing `g_wifi_disconnect_count`/`g_wifi_last_disc_ts_us`), **WiFi Link** (RSSI, channel, own MAC via `esp_wifi_get_mac`), **SD Card** (card CID name, size/free, and a **last-write-ok flag** as the closest thing to a "health" signal FAT/SDMMC exposes — no SMART equivalent exists for SD, so `storage.c` now tracks whether the most recent capture or visit-log write actually succeeded), **Camera** (sensor PID, resolution, current JPEG quality), and **Species ID** — which honestly reports "not available yet" via a new `classify_last_duration_ms()` stub (always -1) rather than fabricating a number ahead of §3.2. Verified live: heap/uptime/reconnect fields sane on the reference unit, SD card fields matched the mounted 64 GB card, camera card showed the correct sensor PID and live-adjustable quality, no-camera/no-SD states render their "bad" (red) status correctly. Firmware 0.9.0.
- v1.9 — **Settings tab implemented (firmware 0.8.0), §5 now live; NTP server made configurable.** `settings.c` moves off the scaffold: every field gets its own NVS key (not a blob) so a future new field falls back to its default instead of invalidating every stored setting on a version bump. Settings tab exposes placement mode, motion sensitivity/frames/interval/cool-down, confidence threshold, SD retention cap, stream/capture JPEG quality (`camera_set_quality()` re-programs the sensor live, no reboot), timezone, IR LED mode, and a **region selector for the future species model (§3.2)** — options are read live from whatever files sit in `/sd/model` (`GET /api/settings` lists them), so the region choice is future-proofed for the model-swap workflow before classification itself lands; an unmatched saved region shows "(missing from SD)" rather than silently reverting. **NTP server is now configurable** (§3.4/§5): a dropdown of common choices (pool.ntp.org default, regional pools, Google/Cloudflare/NIST) plus a Custom text field, applied via a new `wifi_restart_sntp()` that deinits/reinits `esp_netif_sntp` with the new hostname on a live connection — no reboot required, unlike the WiFi-tab's IP settings. All settings apply immediately per FSD §5's "no reflashing" rule; `POST /api/settings` clamps every numeric field server-side and rejects region/ntp values containing path or quote characters. Verified live: defaults round-tripped through `GET /api/settings` after a fresh flash, a full save (`nestbox`/UTC0/custom region+quality) read back correctly and survived a reboot, then reverted to defaults. Firmware 0.8.0.
- v1.8 — **Stats tab and WiFi tab implemented (firmware 0.7.0); §3.4 statistics and §4.5 static IP now live.** New `stats.c`: aggregates the monthly visit-log CSVs into daily/species/hourly buckets on request (newest 12 log files, 62 day / 24 species caps; a user-corrected label wins over the logged species; pre-SNTP "unsynced" rows count toward species totals but not the date/hour buckets, honouring §3.4's no-~1970-dates rule). New endpoints `GET /api/stats/daily|species|hourly` (§6); the ~2.6 kB aggregate lives on the heap, not an httpd stack, and the list responses stream chunked. Stats tab renders bar rows (visits/day, last 30), a 24-column hour-of-day histogram and a species table (visits, first/last seen) — pure inline JS, no CDN (§3.4). WiFi tab replaces the dashboard's link to the portal page: in-tab network scan + credential save, and the §4.5 IP configuration — DHCP (default) or static IPv4 with server-side validation (`400 invalid IPv4 address` — a syntactically bad static IP would associate but be unreachable, indistinguishable from a hang), persisted in NVS, applied to the STA netif before `esp_wifi_start()`; an invalid *saved* config degrades to DHCP rather than bricking the unit, and the §4.6 boot-button reset now erases IP config too — the documented recovery from an unreachable static address. `max_uri_handlers` 16 → 24 for the five new routes. Verified live on the reference unit: stats cross-check exactly against the card's 8 logged visits (6 in the 21 h bucket of 07-06 + 1 in the 6 h bucket of 07-07 + 1 unsynced species-only row); `999.1.2.3` rejected with 400; full static-IP round-trip — saved the current DHCP address as static, device rebooted and came back reachable with `static:true` and matching live values, then reverted to DHCP and confirmed. Firmware 0.7.0.
- v1.7 — **Gallery tab implemented (firmware 0.6.0), first slice of the §5 tabbed UI.** Dashboard rebuilt as the real tab bar (Live | Gallery | WiFi-link; remaining tabs land with their subsystems). Live tab: stream + status ticker + Snapshot-to-SD button; **leaving the Live tab drops the stream `img src` to free one of the two §3.3 stream slots**. Gallery tab: day selector built from new `GET /api/days` (day-folders + file counts), thumbnail grid from new `GET /api/events?date=` (files + sizes; lazy-loaded, newest first), click-through to full size, per-capture delete via new `DELETE /captures/...` (traversal-guarded, confirm dialog). Both listing endpoints stream chunked JSON — no fixed buffer to outgrow on a full card. Favorites and species-label correction (§3.4) deferred to the species-ID milestone, which brings the event metadata they attach to; `GET /api/events` currently lists files rather than the FSD §6 event objects — the API shape converges when events gain IDs/metadata with §3.2. Verified live: day list and file list match the card's real contents (incl. a 4-frame motion burst from §3.1's follow-up logic), throwaway snapshot created → deleted → confirmed 404. Firmware 0.6.0.
- v1.6 — **Motion-triggered capture implemented (firmware 0.5.0), §3.1 live.** `motion.c`: detection frames are the sensor's JPEGs decoded at 1/8 scale (SVGA → 100×75) via `esp_jpeg`, reduced to grayscale (green channel — differencing needs a stable transform, not colorimetry); per-pixel delta > 25 counts as changed; motion when the changed area exceeds a sensitivity-derived threshold (sensitivity 0→11 %, 50→6 %, 100→1 % of frame); rolling background is a 7/8-EMA updated **only on no-motion frames** so a stationary bird isn't absorbed mid-visit, and re-seeded after each event's cool-down. Event pipeline in the motion task: first frame saved immediately, then up to `capture_count`−1 follow-ups at `capture_interval_ms`, **stopping early when motion ends between frames**; then a visit-log CSV row (`storage_append_visit_log()`, monthly `/sd/log/visits-YYYY-MM.csv` with header on creation, species "unclassified" until §3.2) and the `cooldown_s` cool-down. §7's single-writer requirement satisfied by the motion task + write mutex (API snapshots share the mutex) — no separate queue task needed at this producer count. `/api/status` gains `motion`/`events`/`lastEvent`; dashboard ticker shows them with a link to the latest capture (2 s refresh). Verified live: a hand-wave in front of the reference unit triggered event #1 within seconds of boot, one frame saved (early-stop correct — the hand had left), status fields updated, frame fetched back over LAN. Firmware 0.5.0.
- v1.5 — **microSD storage implemented (firmware 0.4.0), §7 partially live.** `storage.c`: SDMMC 1-bit mount at `/sd` (CLK 39 / CMD 38 / D0 40 — the assumed Freenove layout from v1.2, now **verified live**: 64 GB card mounts and round-trips data on the reference unit); never auto-formats a user's card; creates `/captures` `/log` `/model`; missing/unmountable card degrades to a clear no-SD state (§7). `storage_save_jpeg()` writes `/captures/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS.jpg` from the SNTP clock, uptime-named files under `no-date/` before first sync, same-second collisions get a letter suffix. Writes serialized by mutex for now — the §7 queue-based writer task is deferred to the motion-capture pipeline, its first asynchronous producer. New endpoints (§6): `POST /api/capture` (manual snapshot → SD, returns path+size), `GET /captures/...` (static JPEG serving from SD; wildcard route, path-traversal guarded), and `/api/status` gains `sdPresent`/`sdTotalMB`/`sdFreeMB`. Verified end-to-end over LAN: API snapshot saved with correct timestamp path and fetched back byte-identical. Remaining from §7: retention pruning (arrives with capture pipeline), visit-log CSVs (arrives with §3.4).
- v1.4 — **Live MJPEG streaming implemented (firmware 0.3.0), §3.3 now live.** `camera.c`'s temporary auto-probe replaced by real init against the `board_config.h` pin map: JPEG at SVGA 800×600 (the §3.3 stream default), 2 frame buffers in PSRAM, `CAMERA_GRAB_LATEST` so a slow client can't back the sensor up; a missing camera degrades to a clear "no camera" state (503 on `/stream`, `camera_available()` for the UI) instead of aborting boot. New `GET /stream`: `multipart/x-mixed-replace` MJPEG. **Design note: ESP-IDF's httpd is single-threaded, so an endless synchronous stream handler would block every other request; each stream client runs in its own FreeRTOS task via `httpd_req_async_handler_begin()` on port 80** — considered and rejected the esp32-camera example's second-httpd-on-:81 approach, which would break the FSD §6 single-origin API. Max 2 concurrent clients (503 beyond, §3.3). Root dashboard now embeds the live stream with a 5 s status ticker. Verified end-to-end over the LAN on the reference unit: ~17 JPEG frames pulled in 4 s by an external client, sample frame decoded correctly, `/api/status` responsive while streaming. Firmware 0.3.0.
- v1.3 — **WiFi provisioning implemented (firmware 0.2.0), §4 now live.** `wifi.c` + `web_server.c` port the RemoteStart flow: first-boot SoftAP portal (`BirdBox-Config`/`birdbox1234`, setup page at 192.168.4.1 with network scan, URL-decoded credential save to NVS, reboot); boot connect 15 s/5 retries; **on connect-failure with stored credentials the portal opens in APSTA mode and retries the stored network every 60 s in the background, rebooting into normal mode if it succeeds** (§4.4 — implemented as specified, note this *differs* from RemoteStart, which stops STA retries entirely while its portal is open); once ever-connected, in-service disconnects retry indefinitely and never reopen the portal; `WIFI_PS_NONE` + max TX power; boot button (GPIO0) held ≥ 5 s at power-up erases credentials; SNTP (`pool.ntp.org`) + settings timezone started on connect. Web server carries the RemoteStart httpd lessons (LRU purge, handler headroom, loud registration failures) and serves: portal/setup page, placeholder dashboard, `GET /api/scan`, `GET /api/status` (minimal), `POST /api/reboot`, `POST /wifi-save`. Verified live on the reference unit: portal AP + DHCP up, 6 routes registered, camera probe unaffected. Static IP (§4.5) and the full WiFi tab remain for the web-UI milestone.
- v1.2 — **Reference hardware identified and pinned (§2.1).** The project's physical unit (sold as "ESP32-CAM OV2640" on eBay) is actually a generic **ESP32-S3-CAM, N16R8** (ESP32-S3 QFN56 rev v0.2, 16 MB flash, 8 MB embedded octal PSRAM) — identified via esptool chip probe plus a temporary firmware auto-probe in `camera.c` that tried known S3 camera pin maps until SCCB answered: the ESP32-S3-EYE/Freenove map matched (XCLK 15, SIOD/SIOC 4/5, OV2640 at 0x30, PID 0x26), confirmed with a live 800×600 JPEG test frame. `board_config.h` gains a `BOARD_ESP32S3_CAM_GENERIC` block (now the default) with the verified camera pins; LED and SD pins marked TODO-verify. S3 build bumped from assumed 8 MB to real 16 MB flash: OTA slots grown to 2×4 MB and a new 7.9 MB FAT `model` data partition added as the on-flash fallback location for the species model (§3.2). The camera probe stays in `camera.c` until the real capture pipeline replaces it — it doubles as a bring-up diagnostic for other boards.
- v1.1 — Project scaffolded (firmware 0.1.0): ESP-IDF project at repo root with per-target `sdkconfig.defaults.esp32s3`/`.esp32` and partition tables (8 MB S3 with 2×3 MB OTA slots; 4 MB ESP32-CAM with the RemoteStart layout), one stub module per subsystem in `main/` (`wifi` `web_server` `camera` `motion` `capture` `classify` `settings` `storage`, each marked `TODO(FSD §…)`), `esp32-camera` as a managed component, `board_config.h` with pin maps for Seeed XIAO ESP32S3 Sense (default) and AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM, CI workflow (build both targets on every push; `v*` tag → GitHub Release with both `.bin`s), README, MIT LICENSE, docs/ placeholder. No functional requirements changed.
- v1.0 — Initial specification.

## 1. System Overview

BirdBox is an open-source, WiFi-connected nest box / bird feeder camera built on an **ESP32-S3 camera module** running **ESP-IDF** (native Espressif SDK — no Arduino framework). It watches a nest box or feeder, detects bird activity, captures photos/short clips, identifies the species with an on-device AI model, and serves everything through its own built-in web UI: live view, capture gallery, and visit statistics.

The device is fully self-contained: no cloud service, no companion app, and no external server is required. Everything — capture storage, species identification, the web dashboard — runs on the device itself, with captures stored on a microSD card. It is designed for public/open-source users: any hobbyist should be able to buy the supported hardware, flash a release binary, join it to their WiFi via the first-boot portal, and mount it on a nest box.

```

```

**Development framework:** ESP-IDF v6.x (native Espressif SDK). Project structure, build system (`idf.py`/CMake), WiFi provisioning, web server, OTA and CI conventions follow the proven patterns from the RemoteStart project (`D:\SteinsRootMappe\Claude\RemoteStart`).

## 2. Hardware

### 2.1 Target board

| Board | MCU | Camera | PSRAM | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Generic "ESP32-S3-CAM"** (N16R8: 16 MB flash, 8 MB octal PSRAM; ESP32-S3-EYE/Freenove-compatible camera pin map) | ESP32-S3 (dual-core LX7, vector instructions) | OV2640 | 8 MB (required) | **Primary target & the project's reference unit** (identified 2026-07-06 by SCCB probe: sensor PID 0x26, camera pin map verified live). Other S3 camera boards (XIAO ESP32S3 Sense, Freenove, S3-EYE) supported via `board_config.h`. |
| AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM | ESP32 classic | OV2640 | 4 MB | Secondary/constrained target: capture, streaming and gallery work; on-device species ID reduced or disabled (§3.2) |

Exact pin maps are board-specific and defined per-board in a `board_config.h`; the FSD does not fix GPIO numbers. Required peripherals:

| Peripheral | Interface | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Camera sensor (OV2640 or better) | DVP via `esp32-camera` component | Photo/clip capture, live stream, motion detection |
| microSD card | SDMMC (1-bit or 4-bit) or SPI, FAT32 | Capture storage, visit log database |
| PIR motion sensor (optional) | GPIO input | Low-power wake / first-stage motion trigger |
| IR LED illuminator (optional) | GPIO output | Inside-nest-box viewing in darkness (requires IR-filter-less sensor variant) |
| Status LED | GPIO output | Boot/WiFi/portal state indication (blink patterns, RemoteStart-style) |

### 2.2 Placement variants

The same firmware supports two mounting scenarios, selected in settings (§5):

- **Nest box mode** — camera inside a closed box, close focus, IR illumination, activity is relatively rare and long-duration (nesting).
- **Feeder mode** — camera pointed at a feeder/perch in daylight, activity is frequent and short (visits of seconds), species variety is high.

The mode primarily tunes motion-detection sensitivity, capture cadence and statistics presentation; the feature set is identical.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Motion-triggered capture

- Continuous camera-based motion detection: low-resolution grayscale frame differencing against a rolling background, with configurable sensitivity threshold and a minimum-changed-area filter to reject leaves/light changes.
- Optional PIR pre-trigger: when a PIR sensor is fitted, it acts as the first stage (and, in a future battery variant, a deep-sleep wake source); camera-diff confirms before capture.
- On trigger, the device captures a **visit event**:
  - 1 full-resolution JPEG immediately, plus up to N (default 5, configurable) follow-up frames at a configurable interval while motion persists,
  - optionally a short MJPEG clip (default off — SD write bandwidth permitting).
- Debounce/cool-down (default 10 s, configurable) so one continuous visit produces one event, not dozens.
- Each event is written to microSD as `/captures/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS_<seq>.jpg` plus one row in the visit log (§3.4).
- Retention: configurable cap on SD usage (default 80 %); oldest day-folders are pruned first. Events whose species ID is flagged "favorite" by the user are exempt from pruning.

### 3.2 AI species identification

- Every visit event's best frame is classified on-device by a quantized bird-species model (esp-dl / TFLite-Micro int8, running on the S3's vector unit).
- Model: a compact classifier (MobileNet-class, ~1–4 MB, loaded from SD) trained on garden/feeder species. The model file lives on the SD card so users can swap models/regions without reflashing (Settings → Region, or `POST /model/upload`). **v1 default: Google's iNaturalist-birds model** (MobileNetV2, 965 species worldwide incl. a "background" guard class, Apache-2.0; distributed uint8, converted once to int8 with `tools/convert_model_int8.py` — see `docs/MODEL.md`) — global rather than the originally-planned Northern-Europe-only list, since it's a proven, freely downloadable model that covers the Northern-Europe species; purpose-trained regional models remain the intended upgrade path.
- Output per event: top-3 species with confidence scores; results below a configurable confidence threshold (default 60 %) are labeled **"Unidentified bird"** rather than guessed.
- Species names display in a user-selected language (Settings → Species name language: English or Norwegian; see `species_i18n.c`); the scientific (Latin) binomial is always shown alongside it regardless of language, so identification is never ambiguous.
- A "no bird" class guards against false triggers (squirrels, wind); such events are kept but flagged, and can be auto-pruned.
- The user can correct a wrong label from the gallery; corrections are stored with the event (and can optionally be exported to help improve the shared model — see §9).
- **ESP32-classic fallback:** on non-S3 hardware inference is disabled or limited to bird/no-bird; the UI shows captures as "Unclassified". All other features work identically.
- Classification is asynchronous: capture and storage are never delayed waiting for inference; the label attaches to the event when ready (typically < 5 s later).

### 3.3 Live streaming / remote viewing

- MJPEG live stream over HTTP (`/stream`), viewable in any browser on the LAN — embedded in the web UI's Live tab and usable as a direct URL (e.g. as a camera source in Home Assistant/VLC).
- Configurable stream resolution/quality, independent of capture resolution; default 800×600 to keep capture quality unaffected.
- At most 2 concurrent stream clients (memory bound); further clients get HTTP 503 with a clear message.
- Streaming and motion detection coexist: while a client streams, motion detection keeps running (detection uses its own low-res frames).
- Remote (outside-LAN) viewing is explicitly **out of scope for the device itself** — no cloud relay, no port-forwarding automation. The documented path is the user's own VPN (WireGuard/Tailscale) to their LAN. This is a deliberate security decision for an open-source device.

### 3.4 History & statistics

- Every visit event is appended to a visit log on SD (`/log/visits.csv`, append-only, one file per month): timestamp, species, confidence, frame count, file paths, user correction.
- **Gallery tab:** browse captures by day, filter by species, view full-size frames, mark favorites (pruning-exempt), correct species labels, delete events.
- **Statistics tab:**
  - visits per day/week/month (bar chart),
  - species leaderboard (distinct species, visit counts, first/last seen),
  - activity-by-hour-of-day profile,
  - "new species" flag when a species appears for the first time.
- Charts are rendered client-side in the web UI from JSON APIs (§6); the device only serves data, keeping firmware HTML small (RemoteStart pattern: single-file embedded UI, no external CDN dependencies — the UI must work with no internet access).
- Time base: SNTP, server configurable in Settings (default `pool.ntp.org`), timezone configurable (default `Europe/Oslo`, auto-DST). Until first sync, events get a placeholder timestamp and are re-based when the clock syncs — statistics never show ~1970 dates (lesson from RemoteStart §6.1).

## 4. WiFi Configuration (First Startup)

Identical in design to the RemoteStart project's provisioning (its FSD §4 / `main.c` WiFi section), reimplemented in this codebase:

1. On first power-up — or any boot where NVS holds no WiFi credentials — the unit opens a SoftAP config portal:

   | AP Name | Password |
   |---|---|
   | `BirdBox-Config` | `birdbox1234` |

2. The portal page (served at the AP's root, `192.168.4.1`) offers a **WiFi network scan** — the user picks their SSID from the scanned list (or types a hidden one) and enters the password.
3. Credentials are URL-decoded and saved to NVS (`ssid`/`pass` in the `birdbox` namespace); the unit reboots and connects as a STA.
4. Boot-time connect: 15 s timeout / 5 retries. On failure **with stored credentials**, the unit reopens the portal *in APSTA mode* while continuing to retry in the background (a nest box may be at the edge of range; the portal must not permanently strand a temporarily-offline unit). Once connected the first time, in-service disconnects retry indefinitely and never reopen the portal (RemoteStart v1.25 lesson).
5. A **WiFi tab** in the normal web UI (always available, not just first boot) allows changing SSID/password and choosing **DHCP or static IP** (IP/mask/gateway/DNS, server-side IPv4 validation, invalid saved config falls back to DHCP) — the RemoteStart v1.37/v1.38 design.
6. Credentials reset: hold the boot button ≥ 5 s at power-up → NVS WiFi namespace erased → portal reopens.
7. `WIFI_PS_NONE` and max TX power from day one (RemoteStart v1.32 lesson — modem-sleep latency ruins HTTP streaming), and `httpd` with `lru_purge_enable = true` and handler-count headroom (v1.35/v1.27 lessons).

---

## 5. Web UI

Single-page UI embedded in firmware (no filesystem-served assets, no CDN), tab bar following the RemoteStart standard:

**Live | Gallery | Stats | Settings | Debug | WiFi | OTA Update**

- **Live** — MJPEG stream, snapshot button, current motion-detection state indicator, quick rotation toggle (mirrors the Settings tab's rotation field).
- **Gallery** — §3.4 browsing/labeling.
- **Stats** — §3.4 charts.
- **Settings** — placement mode (nest box/feeder), motion sensitivity, capture count/interval, cool-down, confidence threshold, retention cap, stream quality, image rotation (0/90/180/270, mount-correction), species-model region (§3.2), timezone, NTP server, IR LED mode (off/auto).
- **Debug** — System card (free heap + low-water mark with age, uptime, WiFi reconnect count + last-reconnect age), WiFi Link card (RSSI/channel/own MAC), SD card status (size/free/health), camera sensor status, last-inference timing.
- **WiFi** — §4 step 5, plus a Reboot Now button.
- **OTA Update** — §8.

All settings persist in NVS and apply without reflashing; settings that require a restart (camera resolution) say so and offer the reboot.

---

## 6. REST API

All UI data flows through JSON endpoints, so the device is scriptable/integrable (Home Assistant etc.) without scraping:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/status` | GET | Current state: motion, last event, species, SD/heap/WiFi summary |
| `/api/sysinfo` | GET | Debug-card data (heap, heapMin+age, uptime, reconnects) |
| `/api/events?date=&species=&page=` | GET | Paged visit log |
| `/api/events/<id>` | PATCH / DELETE | Correct species label, favorite, delete |
| `/api/stats/daily`, `/api/stats/species`, `/api/stats/hourly` | GET | Chart data |
| `/api/capture` | POST | Manual snapshot now |
| `/api/settings` | GET / POST | Read/write settings |
| `/api/ipconfig`, `/api/ipconfig/save` | GET / POST | DHCP/static IP (RemoteStart design) |
| `/api/reboot` | POST | Reboot |
| `/stream` | GET | MJPEG live stream |
| `/captures/...` | GET | Static serving of stored JPEGs from SD |
| `/ota/upload` | POST | Raw `.bin` firmware upload (§8) |
| `/api/classify` | POST | Classify a posted JPEG now — top-3 + decision (§3.2) |
| `/model/upload?name=` | POST | Install a model/labels file into `/sd/model` (§3.2) |

No authentication in v1 (LAN-only device, same posture as RemoteStart); an optional basic-auth password is a v2 candidate and noted in §11.

## 7. Storage

- **microSD (FAT32)**: captures (`/captures/YYYY-MM-DD/`), visit logs (`/log/visits-YYYY-MM.csv`), optional model file (`/model/`). The device boots and runs without an SD card — live view still works; capture/history features show a clear "no SD card" state instead of failing silently.
- **NVS**: WiFi credentials, IP config, all §5 settings, favorite-species list.
- SD writes are sequenced through a single writer task (camera capture, log append and HTTP static serving must not interleave mid-file).

---

## 8. OTA Updates

- Web-based OTA (OTA Update tab): upload a `.bin` from the browser, RemoteStart-style, with bounded `httpd_req_recv()` retries (v1.5 lesson) and dual OTA partitions with rollback on boot failure.
- Release binaries are produced by CI (§9) so open-source users never need an ESP-IDF toolchain to stay current: download `birdbox-vX.Y.Z.bin` from GitHub Releases → OTA tab → upload.

---

## 9. GitHub, CI & Open-Source Deliverables

- **Repository:** GitHub, public when ready for release. Layout:
  ```
  BirdBox/
  ├── FSD_BirdBox.md          # this document — updated with a changelog entry per change (RemoteStart practice)
  ├── README.md               # user-facing: hardware list, wiring, flash & first-boot walkthrough
  ├── LICENSE                 # MIT
  ├── main/                   # ESP-IDF app (C)
  ├── components/             # esp32-camera, esp-dl model runner
  ├── docs/                   # enclosure/mounting notes, model-swap guide
  └── .github/workflows/      # CI
  ```
- **CI (GitHub Actions):** every push builds with the pinned ESP-IDF version for both targets (esp32s3 primary, esp32 fallback); a `v*` tag creates a GitHub Release with the built `.bin` files and auto-generated per-target version lines (RemoteStart v1.16 pattern).
- **Versioning:** `FIRMWARE_VERSION` in `version.h`, semver; FSD changelog is the change record.
- **Open-source posture:** issues/PRs welcome; docs must be good enough that a stranger with the listed hardware succeeds without asking. Community label corrections (§3.2) may be pooled via voluntary GitHub issue uploads to retrain the regional models — no telemetry, ever, and nothing leaves the device automatically.

---

## 10. Development Environment

- ESP-IDF v6.x on Windows (`idf.py build/flash/monitor`), same toolchain installation as RemoteStart/esp32_clock.
- `idf.py set-target esp32s3` for the primary board.
- `sdkconfig.defaults` per target committed to the repo (PSRAM enabled, camera, FATFS long filenames, httpd tuning per §4.7).

---

## 11. Non-Goals (v1) & Future Candidates

**Out of scope for v1:**
- Cloud services, accounts, or any off-LAN access built into the device (§3.3).
- Audio capture / birdsong identification.
- Battery/solar power management and deep-sleep operation (PIR wake groundwork is laid, §3.1).
- Video with audio; H.264 encoding.
- Web UI authentication.

**Likely v2 candidates:** basic-auth for the web UI, birdsong ID (I2S microphone), battery/deep-sleep mode, MQTT publishing for Home Assistant, multi-camera aggregation page.

---

## 12. Acceptance Criteria (v1)

1. Fresh flash → `BirdBox-Config` portal → scanned SSID selected → device on home WiFi in under 3 minutes, no toolchain needed.
2. A bird landing at the feeder produces exactly one visit event with ≥ 1 sharp full-res JPEG on SD and a visit-log row.
3. A common regional species in good light is correctly top-1 identified ≥ 70 % of the time; low-confidence events say "Unidentified bird", never a confident wrong guess above threshold.
4. Live stream viewable in a browser while captures continue to be recorded.
5. Stats tab correctly aggregates a week of real events by day, species and hour.
6. OTA from GitHub Release binary succeeds and survives a mid-upload abort without wedging the web server.
7. Device runs ≥ 7 days unattended with no reboot, no heap-low-water regression, and survives router reboots (indefinite reconnect).
